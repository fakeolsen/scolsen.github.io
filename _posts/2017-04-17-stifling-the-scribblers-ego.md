We've hit upon a good rhythm, and ink flows freely on the page. What pithy expressions, what grand thoughts we're capable of capturing! What's this? We're distracted by a grand---an *imposing*---word. Prodigious, stinking, it *steals* our attention. It is a word obscure---a rare gem we're certain is undervalued. Our mouths water, we're tempted to shovel it out and appraise it on the page---but we're duped by its shimmering beauty---we've forgotten to ask whether the diamond *fits!* Gems and heads too big for their seats only look ridiculous. We've fallen victim to that old writer's pride, that scribbler's temptation---we want our words to *impress*. 

The writer's task is not glamourous. He is foremost a *servant* to his audience. Readers have two ruling desires: to be enlightened or entertained. Any creeping phrase or clever turn that does not service either of these ends is ripe for elimination---that is, if your aim is to be a *fine writer*. Even the artist is somewhat fettered by these constraints. She can of course choose to shrug them off---her art would shimmer with the fire of radical, novel creation!---but she must acknowledge the risk of being unread. Does that prospect make you shiver? Would you hate to be forgotten? Is it art then, driving you, or something else---another drive under the cloak of art? A will to art, or a will to---

> "Glory and curiosity are the scourges of our souls. The latter induces us to have an oar in every ship, and the former forbids us to leave anything unresolved or undecided."[^cf1]

Who is more susceptible to the charms of the self than the writer? He thirsts after everything and has the unquenchable spirit of a deep-diver. His is a promethean effort---he hopes to challenge lofty, unseen gods and disperse their fires. But a promethean boast is soured the moment pride pounces on generosity. He defeats himself by reclaiming his gifts for his own ascent---for lording over. We want to tie him to the rocks! The eagle of the critic picks at his stomach---what of his superior thievery now? But we are too cruel. These *prideful givers* are necessary---pompous charity is charity still, and does good in spite of murky, subterranean intentions. However, when intoxication in one's own power finds itself in the written word it tends to strain, strangle, and suffocate our prose. The writer has failed the moment we begin guessing at his opinion of himself. His *point* is subordinated to his character. Ah, but how difficult it is to avoid writing of ourselves, when ourselves, no matter what disguises we employ, are always our subjects. 

Nietzsche is a fine example of a *restrained*, *useful* author's pride---his writing cracks with power he takes occasions to acknowledge. However, his pride surfaces only to reinvigorate---to reinforce his message---to *urge us to the ships!*[^cf2] Would we board the vessel of a captain who was not proud of his ship, his stature, his voyage? No! Moping and dismal sailors stick our feet to the shore. You have your pride---*use it!* Make your pride a powder horn---sound the call! Rally! The blare of your horn is stronger than the *hoarseness* in your voice.

> "When his work opens its mouth, the author has to shut his."[^cf3]

Perhaps this was useful reading? Perhaps not. It matters little---for the greatest instant of a writer's pride comes at the start---that he deems something worth writing in the first place. This art serves as something of a relief---a release of tension. Should another choose to read it, so be it! For the author---the writing ought to be enough.
