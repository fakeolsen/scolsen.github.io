ex: "Philosophy is a term so commonly tossed around, so carelessly employed, that even corporations have quite successfully brought it under their fold have employed it to profitable use, for anything the corporation employs is for profit. At the risk of sounding--rather, at the risk of *being* pedantic, I'd argue that we've done horrors to this term, which deserves much more of our love and respect."

Philosophy is a term so commonly tossed around, so carelessly employed, that even corporations have quite successfully brought it under their fold have employed it to profitable use, for anything the corporation employs is for profit. At the risk of sounding--rather, at the risk of *being* pedantic, I'd argue that we've done horrors to this term, which deserves much more of our love and respect. 

In the space of the corporation, or the business, the business's philosophy is at best a shadow, a cloak, a mask, a jumble of words which signify nothing but their status as deceptions. A business which subscribes to the model of capital and embraces the function of the economy can only have one philosophy: profitability. There is nothing more. Any business, within the economic space, necessarily has a predefined telos. A business which forsakes this prescribed end will either succeed and upend the entire economic system, or it will take the course economics predicts for such rebels--it will cease to remain tenable within the economic space. Closures, debts, etc. are all that lie in the future of a business that truly undertakes the pursuit of its so called "philosophy". 

In other, more respectable corners, the term is casually used to refer to the ideas of certain philosophers, or general theoretical constructs devised by said philosophers. As such, persons claim to be existentialists, utilitarians, Kantian, etc. However, even in the academic realm, the term is somewhat loosely passed around. In one sense it has the role of serving as a bucket, a generalized term which signifies the more specific philosophical pursuits, just as "science" is an umbrella term for the sciences. Thus, philosophy refers to epistemology, ontology, ethics, etc. However, philosophy is also employed to signal the particular ideas of an individual--their general interpretation of life, or a theory of practice. It is a term rife with applications. 

I'm not some kind of meaning purist. That our words are overloaded in their senses is in part what makes them operate so well, and makes possible various worlds of human endeavor. Yet I do wonder if the term philosophy requires clarification in the way in which it relates to the varied fields under its umbrella--when can we truly consider a new conceptual apparatus a "philosophy"? 

Take the instance of existentialism. Was existentialism, the moment its infamous *ontological* premise was devised, already formulated as a full-blown *philosophy?* Or is more required? Is a new mode of thought, a new way of life, considered a philosophy only when it has explored and made pronouncements on all those fields which fall under philosophical concern? Must it treat, for instance, epistemology, ontology, ethics, etc. in order to be considered a full-blown philosophy? 

Again the comparison with science proves interesting--a man can practice a science, study a science, but he hardly ever *has* a science, unless by has you mean to indicate the science he studies. Furthermore, it is never a requirement of a science that it treat of the concerns of the other fields which fall under the umbrella term "science" -- i.e. biology did not have to make considerable presumptions about physics in order to legitimize itself as a science (though actually this is a fascinating question and in the assertion here I am making a tremendous leap! IT actually quite possible every scientific filed has a host of quiet assumptions as to the truth of the premises of other scientific fields--any science rooted in physics, at least, very clearly has some assumptions regarding that father branch of inquiry). However, for an approach to life--a summation of variant philosophical positions in terms of the variant fields of philosophy to *be* a philosophy, the philosophy must have satisfied itself with the problems of those fields. 

It is perhaps better to employ Wittgenstein's *Lebensform* to indicate those *philosophies*, existentialism, utilitarianism, etc. which are, presumably, not only to settle the questions of *Philosophy* ontology, epistemology, etc. but also to instruct us or dictate, to a certain extent, the ways in which we live--should we follow their propositions and rules.

With such clarities however, we lose a considerable amount of play.
