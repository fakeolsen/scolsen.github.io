So you've gone ahead and written the thing. The pivotal decision looms: is it
time to share your efforts with the world? Well, certainly, we'd like to answer.
After all, we've typed and marked our way through several drafts, we've
scrutinized every participle and period, we've hollered at tear-stained pages.
It'd be cruel to leave this work sitting in our personal pile after
all that effort, no? Of course, of course--no one appreciates wasted
hours. But aspirant writers must face a hard truth: it is the proper fate of some pieces to remain 
sentenced to a life among private notes, leud doodles, and scattered papers, no matter how ambitious a
future we might have envisaged for them. Our work is finished. The pen rests. It
is time for our pronouncement. The destiny of these pages, publicaiton or
purgatory pile, hangs on one humble question:
*Why would anyone read this?*

A difficult question to answer. We have our reasons, after all, for picking up
the pen in the first place. We've hastily scratched an impassioned response to current
events, we've made a marvelous discovery, we've grown as a person. A writer is
never lacking in urges to write, even if she may face the occasional blockage. Thus, it's
easy to forbear the question and take our own motivation as justification. Of
course we want to share our work; it's done! We've finished it! The idea has
come off well! But often we write, because the need to do so is an urgent one,
before assessing whether our writing is sufficiently interesting to others.

The answer to this question is frequently 
a disappointing *no*.

But all is not for naught. Regardless of whether you've written something others
will read, you've at least completed the exercise. Chances
are it taught you something, perhaps no major lessons, but some valuable
schooling nonetheless. So the answer is no. So someone else has said everything
you thought already, and, by god, has done it better. This doesn't reduce every effort to solve
those same problems to a futile reinvention of well-oiled and
fine-tuned wheels. The wheel-smith's depth of understanding
increases as he tackles old problems, and writing your way through difficulties
fine way to learn, even if it turns out you didn't have much to say. But I
should hardly need to convince you of this, the schoolroom essay is based on
this principle. I supposse I don't follow my own advice.

Besides, there's hope yet. That vast, unruly field known
as difference of opinion has great clout in the realm of writing. Every man is both
incredibly unoriginal and incredibly unique, and it's unlikely that he shares the perspective of
another down to every particular. Take pride in those disgraced and dismal
failures sentenced to an eternity in the slush pile--you never know, they may
find fans in future climates. The practice and
continued dedication to this scribbler's craft are important, and doubtless, even if your
piece attains no further glory than the trash bin, the waning, desk-bound, bleary-eyed, hours you spent together remain
invaluable. Or at least that's what you should write on the farewell card.
