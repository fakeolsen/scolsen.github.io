So you've gone ahead and written the thing. The pivotal decision looms: is it
time to share your efforts with the world? Well, certainly, we'd like to answer.
After all, we've typed and marked our way through several drafts, we've
scrutinized every participle and period, we've hollered at tear-stained pages.
It'd be cruel to leave this work sitting in our personal pile after
all that effort, no? Of course, of course--no one appreciates wasted
hours. But aspirant writers must face a hard truth: it is the proper fate of some pieces to remain 
sentenced to a life among private notes and scattered papers, no matter how ambitious a
future we might have envisaged for them. Our work is finished. The pen rests. It
is time for our pronouncement. The destiny of these pages hangs on one humble question:
*Why would anyone read this?*

A difficult question to answer. We have our reasons, after all, for picking up
the pen in the first place. We have some impassioned response to current
events, we've made a marvelous discovery, we've grown as a person. A writer is
never lacking in urges to write, even if she may face the occasional blockage. Thus, it's
easy to forbear the question and take our own motivation as a fair justification. Of
course, we want to share our work; it's done! We've finished it! The idea has
come off well! But often we write, because the need to do so is an urgent one,
before assessing whether our writing is sufficiently interesting to others.

You'll feel the answer more than you'll reason it out--and it may frequently be
a disappointing *no*.

But all is not for naught. Regardless of whether you've written something others
will read, you've at least completed the exercise. Chances
are it taught you something; perhaps no major lessons, but some valuable
schooling nonetheless. Programming presents a fine parallel case. Most
programmers are lazy, and a great deal of problems in the programming world have
already been solved. Frequently, aside from minor spats
about performance, another coder has likely already concocted a fine solution to many of
the programming problems you face and has neatly wrapped them all
up in a user-friendly library. However, this doesn't reduce every effort to solve
those same problems to a futile reinvention of well-oiled and
fine-tuned wheels. The wheel-smith's depth of understanding
increases as he tackles root problems, and coding your way through difficulties
that have already been resolved is a fine way to learn new concepts, even if the
end result of your work is redundant.

The analogy isn't perfect; in the case of writing, that vast, unruly field known
as difference of opinion has great clout in the matter. Every man is both
incredibly unoriginal and incredibly unique, and it's unlikely that even if the
gist of his thoughts are the same, that he shares the precise perspective of
another down to every particular. Nonetheless, we sometimes
write a piece that, considered from the perspective of the audience,
simply isn't very enticing--but that doesn't make it worthless. The practice and
continued dedication to this scribbler's craft are important, and doubtless, even if your
piece attains no further glory than the trash bin, the waning desk-bound, bleary-eyed, hours you spent together remain
invaluable.
