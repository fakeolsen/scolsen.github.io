I want to agree with the quietist that we cannot discuss metaphysical topics without
talking past each other. The range of this field is extensive: anything which is
not descriptive, as Wittgenstein would have it. A fundamental question then arises: why all the babbling? Why this human relish in nonsense?
Why these games?

All questions of value become noise. The issue is muddied further by
our descriptions and our sciences. What lies at their root other than value? You might
retort that this driving value is instinctual--value for human life. Fine. You
reduce man to an animal. All that is 'man' in him points to a questioning of
this. Then
absurdists and pessimists were on the right course: the logical status of human life is an
absurdity--a moment, ever vivid, ever brief, of madness.

The moment of the apple is revelatory.
