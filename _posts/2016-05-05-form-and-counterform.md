info: This essay explores a conceptual notion similar to the Foil through the characters of Macbeth. 
ex: "In that arcane and scrupulous art known as typography there exists a notion fundamental to the construction of the letter, the basest of the typographer's elements: *Form and Counterform*. Perhaps notion is a misnomer. Form and Counterform is a relation of constitutive character--change one and you necessarily change the other. The form is the part of the letter we all recognize without difficulty--the actual strokes and shapes which make up the letters. The curves and angles of ink on the page. The counterform is a bit more subtle. It is comprised of the negative space surrounding the letter strokes--the empty innards of the letter o..."
notes: "1. I suggest Willi Kunz's fantastic <i>Typography: Macro and Microaesthetics</i> which covers form, counter form, and many other points of typographic interest."

Use the following to include images, filling out params as needed. 
{% include image.html path="/images/IMG_0001.png" caption="New York's Meat Pacjing District...yum" alt="An image of NYC" %}
Note to never include two images adjacent. Leave a nice paragraph block between them, otherwise they will not display corrently on hd desktop with the current css solution.
Same deal with notes. 
As a work-around, there is an alt layout for image heavy posts. Use image heavy layout.

In that arcane and scrupulous art known as typography there exists a notion fundamental to the construction of the letter, the basest of the typographer's elements: *Form and Counterform*. Perhaps notion is a misnomer. Form and Counterform is a relation of constitutive character--change one and you necessarily change the other. The form is the part of the letter we all recognize without difficulty--the actual strokes and shapes which make up the letters. The curves and angles of ink on the page. The counterform is a bit more subtle. It is comprised of the negative space surrounding the letter strokes--the empty innards of the letter o.  

There are plenty of texts you can consult if you've been struck, suddenly, by the typographer's malady and find yourself drooling over letterforms <sup id ="fnref:1"> <a href="#post-notes" class="footnote">1</a> </sup>. Here however, I'd like to recommend form and counterform as a relational metaphor useful to the construction of *fiction*. 



While this concept is extensive and applies to, possibly, every element that goes into fiction, down to the base unit--the sentence (more on that in a post coming up) I think it is easiest to grasp in terms of characters. Let's take an example from an obscure play titled *Macbeth* Act 1 scene 3. Our characters: Three witches, Macbeth, and Banquo. We'll tackle the witches first. 

Three witches. Not witch one, witch two, and witch three. Just three witches. Why should we deny each witch autonomy and roll them into this blob of a character? Precisely because, at least in 1.3, that's exactly what they are--a single character. Though the witches are each given distinct parts their *form * is singular. This results from the fact that they define the same counterspace and thus lose individual identity. It is a question of contrast. Within typography, one considers the counterspace of the letter, and the counterspace of the *word*. The letter in solitude, is easier to examine. It's clearer what makes an o an o and not a c. Easier to trace its strokes. In a word, the individuality of the letter evaporates. How often do you pause to consider the particular form of the os in the words, form, how, and often, to name just a few I've used in this sentence? The witches are a word. 

Witch one, two, and three are all provided separate lines, but lines which are so similar, which lack contrast, as to render them into a single role. Yes, the witches converse with each other, but it is essentially one character conversing with herself. The witches are all similar in aim and construction. They serve to prophecy the fate of Macbeth and to do more or less witch like things and strike fear into an audience that took the threat of witchcraft more seriously than we do today. The witches lack individuality because there is no counterform between them. No whitespace between their stories. They are recognized as one. The witches do not bicker. No differences arise between them. They are three persons in one character. 

Macbeth and Banquo contrarily serve as an extreme case of form and counter form--the witches are used as what we might call the *ground* the shared space on which the Macbeth/Banquo counterform relation pivots. Shakespeare could have had Macbeth encounter the witches alone--could have axed Banquo's prophecy altogether--after all the play is titled *Macbeth*--however, such a choice would render Macbeth's character quite weaker. We'd still have a sense of what sort of character Macbeth is. We'd still get his reaction to the witch's prophecy, his sudden interest, his keen desire to know more plainly his upcoming future, but the rendering is much flimsier sans Banquo. Banquo is Macbeth's counterspace: a great contrast in reaction to the same event. While Macbeth is seized with desire for the prophecy's fulfillment, Banquo reacts with clarity and caution, questioning whether the prophecy is not some device meant to bring about their doom (1.3.124-125). 

We get a stronger sense of Macbeth's character because of Banquo's severely contrasting attitude, and vice versa. They are form and counterform to each other--to use the traditional terminology, Banquo is a *foil* for Macbeth. I prefer the form and counterform metaphor as it highlights the *mutually constitutive *nature of the relationship--yes, Banquo highlights aspects of Macbeth's character, but Macbeth's character also defines the space we have in which we can even begin to construct a *Banquo*. In essence, when we begin constructing characters, we slowly narrow the scope and extent to which we can render them similar without, as in the case of the witches, eliminating individuality. Ultimately, it comes down to a contrast of *sentences*. Some writers fall into the trouble of having characters that sound like the narrator--this is precisely a form/counterform problem. The narrator too, takes up space--is a bundle of sentences--anyone who is not the narrator must in some fashion contrast or wind up a witch--another stroke in the same letter.
