info: A note on precursor plagiarism 
ex: "It is possible that another may plagiarize your work before you even walk the earth. At least this is the opinion of Gaddis's crazed, railing narrator in *Agapé Apage*. This notion of plagiarism on the part of your precursors, is not, in fact, some presumptuous inclination or idolization of one's own thoughts. It rather communicates the central and sympathetic notion of the novel--that artistic work brings us into a firm *communion* with the artist--our minds are, for the duration of our experience of the artistic work--bonded in a unique and intimate relation. Joseph Tabbi covers this thematic well in his excellent *A Secret History of Agapé Agape*."

I apologize in advance for the pomposity of this essay--it seems impossible to ever mention oneself and "the arts" or artistic work in the same context without assuming airs of some sort. Forgive my audacity, especially as I am unpublished. 

It is possible that another may plagiarize your work before you even walk the earth. At least this is the opinion of Gaddis's crazed, railing narrator in *Agapé Apage*. This notion of plagiarism on the part of your precursors, is not, in fact, some presumptuous inclination or idolization of one's own thoughts.

To be a tad selfish and bring this note down to the level of personal reflection, I myself have experienced, I think, the very sort of sympathy Gaddis is trying to express when reading, funnily enough, his work, as well as that of Beckett's. Prior to reading either of their outputs, my literary ambitions, for a time, were characterized by a style dominated by irruptions, brevity, freneticism, and dialog--all qualities readily found in Beckett and Gaddis's works to variant degrees. 

My first reading of Beckett was an illuminating experience. I felt that I had found, in some way, an old friend--someone I should have met, was meant to meet. Through affinity of style, which I hadn't anticipated, I found that someone, somewhere, at some time had actually thought in a similar fashion as me--and this is doubtless a unique and intimate relation--a vindicative comfort--the artists' success in the public sphere does not matter, merely to find someone who seems to be, incredibly, on such a similar wavelength as yourself, in spite of how utterly and ultimately trapped we all are in our status as subjects, is the very essence of the word blessing. This, perhaps, is the true aim of all pure and respectable art--a sort of unity between subjects--a form of love rendered through artifice. I did not feel as strong an affinity for Gaddis, though his proclivity for a style dominated by dialog is entirely in my field of interest. 

I boldly claim that Gaddis and Beckett have both beaten me to the punch--perhaps, in another life, in another time, I could have been one of them, the Irish or American mastermind. But alas, I will have to settle for the great comfort their work provides. There is hidden here, as well, a notion of progression in the arts. Gaddis and Beckett, being my forbears, have constrained the artistic space, limiting and pushing my art toward new directions--I cannot be a Beckett or a Gaddis--to do would mean I am a mere imitator. I may have been a Gaddis or a Beckett, but because a Beckett and a Gaddis have already happened, perhaps I am encouraged--forced--to be something of my own.
