> **Note:** This is a piece I wrote in December 2011 which was published in Drexel’s [Maya Magazine][1] in 2012. Personally, I find it painful to read. The style is laborious and overwrought. Still, I stand by its message. 

The vagrant, the swine, the downtrodden dreamer, 

My hope for this writ is to serve as redeemer 

I’ve traveled this rift, the one all folk know so well. The furrow dug out by the hackneyed adjudicator, who, just as he is departing, turns and strikes once more: on the street, from the office, from behind the dastards well worn cloak of text, the list goes on. His message is but the maw of a fiend set to tear through the strands of one’s being. He sits atop a throne of fallacious tokens, judging with a swift hand and the lexicon of scorn. None escape the broad reach of the common self-commissioned connoisseur. The sound of his mandate is that of a tiny hairpin slipping into the locks of the self, and unlocking discontent.

It’s a jest; the negative claims of commonplace persons push one to seek the ever-fleeing fable of perfection. Yet, the tiny peccadilloes of life remain meek in the eye of man. Interestingly enough, nearly all persons have been down roads of obsession, of unbridled desire to attain the myth of perfection. It is but an abstract, making the pursuit of it akin to attempting to grasp a distant star in one’s palm. And when I thought of such a wild claim, I would despair; I wondered why I could not achieve this legendary state of being in all of my craft.  That was until one day, as I traversed this disparaging rift that I encountered an interesting hiccup. It was wrong, it was terribly wrong; it marred my work and maintained perfection’s status as a fabricated beast. Remarkably though, I could not shake my perception of it as a thing of great beauty. It was similar to a single tree in an open field. It piqued my interest and altered my mind. 

“No one is perfect” is but a tired truth. Perfection itself is but a ruse. I have learned to accept these tenants. Woe is the man who lets his faults dampen his cause, mind, or spirit. But more must be said, more for those poor fellows drowned in dissatisfaction due to their personal pool of peccadilloes:

One’s faults exist to be harnessed, and when successfully employed,

Man rests in true triumph, perfection destroyed.
