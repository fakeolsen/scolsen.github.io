This is the personal site of Scott Olsen. This site is more or less a content dump of personal essays and other projects. I put them up here for you to enjoy or to scoff at because I've taken a small pretension and assume they might be useful somehow for somebody. In short, think of this as a sort of portfolio. 

The design of this site is pretty bare-bones. That is intentional. I want exploring the site to be a simple, if a little unglorified, experience. I use jekyll to produce the static content of this site. Jekyll is really fantastic, especially for websites that are focused on static content or personal blogs, etc.--like this one. I highly reccomend you check them out if you find yourself in need of that sort of thing: [Jekyll] [2].

I host this site through github pages--a little unorthodox, as I'm not intending to house any coding projects on here (though time will tell). Anyway, you can check that out as well if you are in need of a straightforward way to host a small personal or project dedicated site: [Github Pages] [3]

I'd be more than happy to chat if you want to contact me about anything. You can reach me at my email: [scg.olsen@gmail.com] [1].
