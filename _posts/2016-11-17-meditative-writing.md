Within his reply to Derrida's objections to the monumental *History of Madness*, Michel Foucault makes an important classification between *meditative* and *deductive discursive* writing. The point of debate is Descartes's *Meditations*. Foucault rejects Derrida's reading of this fundamental work, one disagreements revolving around this distinction between meditative and deductive discursive writing. 

Foucault considers meditative writing fundamentally different in that it is a record, a transcription, of a process. A register of events which have a direct effect on the subject, on the meditating author, as he works through the meditation and observes resultant shifts. It is a form of writing which not only renders ambivalence and resolution in the mind of the narrative voice central in its complex of meaning, but which relies entirely on this *change*. The deductive discursive form, contrarily, is writing which is distilled and crystallized into an object--it lacks the meditative form's dynamism. We get a clear sense, from the deductive discursive form, and the force of the writing should indicate this, that the author has already solidified his opinions, and composes only to dissimulate. 

While the Foucault-Derrida debate is fascinating in its own right, I'm more interested in this distinction of the meditative and discursive forms. I am in agreement with Foucault at the moment--at the very least I readily admit the distinction as a concept, in order to explore it further. 

It is clear that these forms extend into other domains. The stream of consciousness novel, for instance, *must* be a meditation--the form of meditation--the struggles of the narrator's own interior, a debate held with the self, core to the meditative text, is integral to the stream of consciousness' status as narrative. Though a moment's consideration reveals the discursive form works for first person narratives as well--just not stream of consciousness ones, for the discursive, in presenting an object, must forsake any sense of present movement or occurrence. The discursive form works in the case of a narrator looking back--a narrator recalling events, and certain as to their import. Of course, we may also have a blending of the two. 

Doubtless a grasp of this concept facilitates clearer writing--regardless of the form you choose, that fact that you are *conscious* of the character of the text clears the path for clarified construction. Some of the strongest essays, for instance, are meditative--Montaigne is famous for imbuing all of his essays with this meditative quality, a constant questioning of himself, a decidedly unsettled character of thought. Keat's concept of *Negative Capability* too, may be reminiscent of this meditative open state--the philosopher's doubt. 

Contrarily, the essays of Samuel Johnson, or at least the majority of them, are clearly discursive. It is inarguably clear that Johnson has done all his thinking far in advance to the production of the finished work. There is a great gulf between the germs of Johnson's first thoughts, whatever they may have been, and those glistening finished products, in which every move is intentional, every opening rationalized, every detail furnished. And Johnson's essays are no less powerful than Montaigne's though their quality is far different. 

Doubtless there's a great deal to explore in this conception, another of Foucault's numerous generosities to the realm of human intellect, especially if we are to take Foucault's suggestion that these categories are not only mere classifications, but should also effect the approaches we take when *interpreting* texts, lest we fall into Derridean folly, where the subject, so pivotal to the meditation, is effaced, leaving us with nothing but sourceless thoughts on empty air.
