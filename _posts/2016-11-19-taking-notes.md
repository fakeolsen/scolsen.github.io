ex: "Note taking is a practice which we all undoubtedly learn in the course of our studies, some of us sticking to it, others abandoning the idea before we give it so much as a fair chance. In either case, it's often a subject of little interest. We learn that to take notes is, at least in the academic system I partook in, a means to an end--often little more than capturing information for memorization, for yielding study material which will facilitate good examination results. We subscribe to this practice quickly, jot down what our teachers say, especially those items that are emphasized as test-worthy, and hardly ever think about note taking, or what constitutes a good note, ever again. Yet the subject is fascinating. "

Note taking is a practice which we all undoubtedly learn in the course of our studies, some of us sticking to it, others abandoning the idea before we give it so much as a fair chance. In either case, it's often a subject of little interest. We learn that to take notes is, at least in the academic system I partook in, a means to an end--often little more than capturing information for memorization, for yielding study material which will facilitate good examination results. We subscribe to this practice quickly, jot down what our teachers say, especially those items that are emphasized as test-worthy, and hardly ever think about note taking, or what constitutes a good note, ever again. Yet the subject is fascinating. 

Foremost, what is the end of taking notes? Is it merely to reinforce the key points of a lecture? Merely to augment the stated knowledge with its repetition, in hopes of solidifying it in the mind? Is it merely a process of transcription, aimed at taking record of information pivotal to gaining high test scores later? Or can it be something more? Personally, I consider our common notions of note taking to be rather poor. The common method of taking notes, at least that I know of, is not one which promotes growth--which I think should be a good note's ultimate telos. Notes should be snapshots--instances of the beginnings of future explorations or threads, questions, concerns, open opportunities for exploration. Instead, we are satisfied with the note being little more than a basic repetition of information. A senseless repeating of what is already there. 

Doubtless, we at times do need to *transcribe*. There is nothing wrong with transcription. However, I'd like to propose we make a division between transcription and *note taking*. Notes should offer more than basic doubles of information. Of course, everyone's note taking habits differ, and so I'm always fascinated to hear about how others take notes, but my feeling is that the majority of us--or at least myself, for a time--as a hold over from our elementary days, often take notes as though we are the court scribe, and must ensure we capture all that the judge, prosecution, and defendants say. 

Rather, I'd urge that notes are far more useful if we prescribe them more focused functions. I find, for my part, three forms of notation indispensable: the index, the annotation, and the question or idea. 

1. The Index

The index's purpose is captured by its name. When reading, if a certain passage strikes with the force of its importance it warrants a simple mark somewhere noting where it occurs in the text, and perhaps a minimal, sentence length synopsis of its contents or the context surrounding it. This has the obvious function of guiding your textual investigations later.

2. The annotation 

The annotation is combined with the index--a passage, in addition to simply amazing us with its poignancy, may provoke some thoughts of our own as to its contents, or some recognition of the careful allusions the author has made. Here it's useful to simply, in addition to the index of the passage, capture our personal opinion of it--the thoughts it provoked. Our thoughts, unless we return to them, have much shorter life spans than we might at first suppose if we do not record them. 

3. The question or Idea

This is the most significant note, and again may be tied to an index, or may come of itself in a bout of inspiration. It is a significant effort, often of at least a few sentences or a paragraph, that captures either a few questions or the germ of an idea, which may be developed further later. This is essentially the form that I follow when composing the notes on this website. None of them are fully or carefully developed thoughts--I do very minimal editing on all of them. They are, at their core, sketches of ideas, the thin ends of threads which I've yet to grasp but may stretch out toward in the future. 

To make a final point, it is also imperative, I think, that after taking notes we actually make the effort to *return* to them and *reread* them. I've been notoriously bad at this myself, but have begun following this practice lately. Returning to notes you've taken years ago--seeing how your perspective has shifted--can be enlightening. Furthermore, you may, at a future period, grow a note into a fully developed project or work, but its impossible to do so if you don't return to the note first. I suppose my point in this brief ramble is that note taking is actually quite a significant epistemic practice, one which we should not underestimate. A grand opportunity for epistemic exploration and the development of knowledge as to our academic and pedagogical practices lies hidden in this simple subject.
